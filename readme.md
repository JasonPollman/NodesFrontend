### Components

**Node**    
The `<Node />` component is the class used to render *every* node type: root, factory, and number.
This sets up a socket listener for the node and updates (re-renders) it when the `nodeWasUpdated:${node.id}` event is emitted by the socket server.

When a node is rendered, it selects a "node-renderer" method based on the node's `type` property and renders the node's content using this method. In this way, we're able to share the base functionality between nodes (updating and managing socket events), but also provide a way to allow the node types
to be presented differently.

It also allows us to create new node types in the future if necessary without having to change
the underlying logic that lives in `<Node />`.

**Application Container**    
The outer wrapper for the entire application.    
Ties together the `<NavBar />`, `<NodeTree />`, and `<InfoCards />` components.

**NavBar**    
The navigation componentâ€”contains the header and the links shown at the top of the page.

**NodeTree**    
This component "initializes" the rendering of the node tree. It emits the `nodeInitialize` socket
event and listens for a response that contains the *full* initial tree rendering.

Once the inital set of nodes has been rendered, we never have to fully re-render the tree since each node listens only for its own update event.

This component also handles socket errors and "toasing" socket messages to the screen (like
when a user upserts a new node).

## Program Flow
- The `<NodeTree />` component emits the `nodeInitialize` event.
- The socket server returns a *full* node tree, which is rendered.
- Each node now listens for only its own `nodeWasUpdated:${node.id}` socket event.
- When these events are emitted, only that subtree is rerendered.
